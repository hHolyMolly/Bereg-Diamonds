SALES AND TRANSACTION PROCESS</h2><div class="text-block__items"><p class="text-block__text">Please let us know about inappropriate content.

We reserve the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to deny you access to the Platform, or any portion of the Platform, without notice and remove any User Content that does not adhere to these guidelines.</p><p class="text-block__text" style="font-weight: 600;">Shipping and Insurance</p><p class="text-block__text">You must send all items to Bereg Diamonds via FedEx or UPS, using the shipping labels we send you. All items sent to us are insured by Brinks and/or Lloyds of London for the amount stated in the e-mail you receive to confirm your insurance up to a maximum of $200,000, unless specific insurance is pre-arranged for your item through us. We insure your items for the higher end of the price range. If no range is communicated to you, then you have the right to request this range. We will communicate to you if you must self-send using your own shipping and insurance.</p><p class="text-block__text">In order to arrange adequate insurance Bereg Diamonds may request further information from you regarding the items you intend to send to us, and we will rely on this information in order to arrange insurance.</p><p class="text-block__text">Bereg Diamonds will open every pack which it receives from you under video, and will weigh and, where relevant, test the items included in the pack, and compare them to the details received from you both prior to your submission of the item, and on any form you sign and send to us. Bereg Diamonds reserves the right to reject any forms (and the items they are sent with) which are not properly completed and signed. Bereg Diamonds also reserves the right to reject delivery of any package which appears to be opened, damaged, or tampered with in any way. Any such packages that we reject will be returned to you – at our cost – but without any liability to Bereg Diamonds.</p><p class="text-block__text" style="font-weight: 600;">Valuation and Offer</p><p class="text-block__text">Once we received your items, our specially trained experts will test and evaluate them to determine their value. Bereg Diamonds may need to remove a diamond to adequately value it. We will ALWAYS contact you and get your consent to the removal of a diamond before doing so.</p><p class="text-block__text">BY SENDING US YOUR ITEMS, YOU HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY ACCEPT THAT THE PROCESS OF DETERMINING A VALUE OF THE METAL MAY INVOLVE PLACING CERTAIN ACIDS ON THE GOLD, SILVER, PLATINUM, OR OTHER ITEMS WHICH CAN LEAVE PERMANENT STAINING AND/OR SCRATCHES. YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT Bereg Diamonds.COM IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY THIS PROCESS OR ANY RESULTING DECREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE ITEMS.</p><p class="text-block__text">If we make you an offer, it will be valid until 5:00 pm EST the following business day. As the prices of diamond, gold, and other precious metals change regularly, our offers cannot generally be extended beyond then. If you accept our offer, the goods will be immediately shipped for diamond removal and melting down, so your acceptance is legally binding on both of us and is irrevocable. Please note that when accepting an offer, any no value items will not be automatically returned to you, unless you specifically request their return at the time of the offer.</p><p class="text-block__text" style="font-weight: 600;">Payments</p><p class="text-block__text">After you accept our offer, we will arrange payment details with you. We will pay by one of the following payment methods:</p><p class="text-block__text">- Direct bank transfer to your account. We can pay straight into any US account of your choice, with funds leaving our account the day after you agree to our offer. There is no charge for this service. We will send you a payment receipt confirming the money has been transferred.</p><p class="text-block__text">- Check. We can send you a check within five (5) business days after you have agreed to our offer. We will send you a payment receipt along with the check to the same address you provided to us in the initial inquiry through the Platform.</p><p class="text-block__text">Nearly all our customers accept the offer we make them, but if you decide not to accept our offer for your items, your goods will be returned to you, at our cost, within five (5) business days from when you decline our offer, unless you are a ‘Self Send Customer’ who has received an email informing you of a $25 to return. However, if you send only items containing no diamonds, there is a $25 fee for returning them, or we can dispose of them free of charge. Your payment must be received within thirty (30) days of our request, or we will dispose of the items.</p><p class="text-block__text" style="font-weight: 600;">Returned Items</p><p class="text-block__text">If our return carrier is not able to return the items because it has been unable to obtain a signature, it will leave an instruction card. If the package is returned to a local delivery office, it will need to be collected within a period of time specified by the carrier. If the package is not collected within this time, it may be returned to us. On receipt of the returned items, we will contact you to arrange for the items to be resent; however there will be a charge of $25 to cover the additional postage and administration costs. Payment must be received within two (2) weeks of contacting you or we reserve the right to purchase the items at our offer price, excluding our</p><p class="text-block__text">administration costs and holding insurance fee. When returning your original items, Bereg Diamonds shall, in its own discretion, choose the return carrier and relevant insurance for each such return. Bereg Diamonds is not liable for any items becoming damaged. We may be independently insured against any such loss, and in the event of any claim, the customer agrees to provide all such information as we or our insurance company may reasonably request, including signing for the returned package.</p><p class="text-block__text" style="font-weight: 600;">Lost Property</p><p class="text-block__text">If you send us items without a completed customer form, it is unlikely we will be able to identify you as the sender unless you have written your name and address on the package. If the shipping label was requested via our website, we may be able to identify you as the sender using the references numbers of the label. If we are not able to identify you as the sender, then the items will be classed as lost property. We will continue to hold these items for a period of six (6) months in a secure area. Customers claiming items will be required to provide a full and detailed description before an offer is made. Once we have confirmed a lost property claim, we will make payment for the items at our then-current price. If the items have been held in excess of three (3) months, a deduction will be made from this payment to cover our storage and administration costs. If a claim is not made within six (6) months, a $7.50 weekly deduction will be made from this payment to cover our storage, administration, and insurance costs.</p><p class="text-block__text" style="font-weight: 600;">Items Sent to Us in Error</p><p class="text-block__text">Our shipping label and envelopes are coded with a unique bar and are for customers sending precious metals with the intent to sell to us. If you use our shipping labels or envelopes to send items intended for someone else, they will still be automatically sent to us. The fee for returning these items is $30, which covers our postage, insurance, and administration costs.</p><p class="text-block__text" style="font-weight: 600;">Counterfeit Items</p><p class="text-block__text">In the event that we cannot confirm the authenticity of your item(s), we will be unable to insure them for a return trip to you, as our insurance would not be valid. We will, of course, return them if you provide shipping instructions. In the further event that the item has been imported by us and duty paid, we will require you to reimburse us for the duty paid prior to our shipping your item back to you.</p></div><h2 class="text-block__second-title">5.
